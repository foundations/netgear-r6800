<h1>ReAIM - AOL Instant Messenger Proxy</h1>
<h2>What is ReAIM ?</h2>

<p>ReAIM is a compact transparent proxy designed to be run on or behind a
Linux IPTables based firewall.  When run behind a simple address-translating
firewall, the current AIM client software does not allow direct-connections
between users to work.  AIM requires direct-connections for file and image
transfers.</p>

<p>This proxy is designed to transparently intercept AIM client messages
and pass them through a configurable filter/rewrite chain.  This allows
selective modification of the source address provided in direct-connection
setup packets, and so remote users can be told to use the global internet
routable address, rather than the actual IP address of the client on the
local network.</p>

<p>I have written a <a href="dcc.html">basic introduction</a> to how the
AIM software sends messages, and the problems it encounters with address
translation and firewalls.  It's worth looking over for a top level 
overview if the previous paragraph didn't make a lot of sense.</p>

<p class="last">Because the code seemed to be coming together nicely in a
modular structure, I've added in support for MS Messenger's file transfer
in a very similar way!</p>

<h2>Current Status</h2>

<p>The current code is alpha quality.  This means that it works for me,
but has many rough edges and plenty of things still to finish and properly
design.</p>

<p class="last">I regularly use the proxy for AIM messaging and file
sharing.  It also has preliminary support for MS Messenger file
transfers.</p>

<h2>Download</h2>

<p class="last">The <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=40800">File
List page</a> at sourceforge holds links to all the released code.  In
general you should use the most recent release, and if you are having
trouble with an earlier release, please try the latest before filling out
a bug report.</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p class="last">I have written a basic overview for setting up the
<a href="setup.html">appropriate firewall rules</a>.  Included in the distribution is a
sample firewall setup script.</p>

<h2>CVS</h2>

<p class="last">The current code can be downloaded from the CVS server at
sourceforge in the usual way.  Instructions are <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=40800">available here</a>.</p>

<h2>Credits</h2>

<p>My thanks to everyone that has worked on decoding the OSCAR protocol
used by AIM.  Without your work, this program would have taken much longer
to produce.</p>

<p>To the Linux Hackers for providing transparent port interception and
redirection - way to go!  iptables is an incredibly powerful framework.</p>

<p class="last">To my friends who introduced me to instant messaging, and
the problems which exist in the current clients and their handling of
firewalls and address translation.</p>
