<h2>Basic Outline</h2>

<p>The AIM client supports two methods to send text messages to other AIM
users.  The first is used unless a direct connection has been established,
and in this mode, all messages pass through an AIM server.</p>

<ol>
<li>Alice on Machine 1 establishes a connection to an AIM server</li>
<ul><li>This works through most firewalls.  It's just a single connection</li></ul>
<li>Bob on Machine 2 establishes a connection to an AIM server</li>
<ul><li>This works through most firewalls.  It's just a single connection</li>
    <li>It is not necessarily the same AIM server as Alice, but this doesn't matter</li></ul>
<li>Alice wants to send a text message to Bob</li>
<ul><li>Alice's machine sends a message to the AIM server it is connected to</li>
    <li>The AIM servers check which machine Bob's connected to, and hands off the message to that AIM server</li>
    <li>Bob receives Alice's message from the AIM server he's connected to</li></ul>
</ol>

<p>In the above process, Alice and Bob have no idea about each other's
internet address - it just isn't required.  However, all the messages are
going through the AIM servers they are connected to.  This costs AOL money,
and also permits them to see all the messages Alice and Bob are exchanging.</p>

<p>Because of the cost, transferring files requires Alice and Bob to establish
a direct connection between each other.  Once this is done, as the name implies,
data flows directly between Alice and Bob, without the AIM servers being
involved - so it doesn't cost AOL any money.</p>

<ol>
<li>Alice on Machine 1 establishes a connection to an AIM server</li>
<ul><li>This works through most firewalls.  It's just a single connection</li></ul>
<li>Bob on Machine 2 establishes a connection to an AIM server</li>
<ul><li>This works through most firewalls.  It's just a single connection</li></ul>
<li>Alice sends a direct connection establishment message to Bob</li>
<ul><li>Alice's machine send a message to the AIM server it is connected to.  This message contains the internet address of Alice's machine</li>
    <li>The AIM servers check which machine Bob's connected to, and hands off the message to that AIM server</li>
    <li>Bob receives Alice's message from the AIM server he's connected to, and once this is received, Bob can try to make a direct connection to the address Alice just sent</li></ul>
</ol>

<p>If Bob establishes a connection to Alice, then everything is fine, and
they have a direct connection established.  If Bob's machine can't contact
Alice's, the direct connection establishment then proceeds as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Bob's machine times out trying to connect to Alice</li>
<li>Bob's machine sends a message to Alice via the AIM server, containing his internet address, and waits for Alice to connect to him</li>
<li>Alice receives the message from Bob via the AIM server she is connected to, and attempts to connect to Bob</li>
</ol>

<p class="last">At this point, Alice either successfully connects to Bob, or another timeout
happens.  If the timeout happens, both Bob and Alice's AIM clients will tell
them that the connection couldn't be established.</p>

<h2>The Issue Of Address Translation</h2>

<p>One reason for Alice and Bob being unable to connect to each other is if
there is an Address-Translating firewall between their machine and the AIM
server they connect to.  In essence, this usually means that their machine
cannot be directly reached from anywhere else on the internet.  Consider
the diagram below:</p>

<pre>
       Local LAN                  Internet
  [alice]---+-----[firewall]---------------+--[AIM Server Cluster]
 10.0.0.5   | 10.0.0.1   A.B.C.D           |
            |                              |
  [others]--+                              +--[Bob]
                                             W.X.Y.Z

</pre>

<p class="last">A.B.C.D is the only address that the rest of the internet can contact
directly.  Unfortunately, in the direct connection setup, Alice's machine
doesn't know this, and so uses 10.0.0.5 in her message to Bob.</p>

<h2>A Solution: The ReAIM Proxy</h2>

<p>The ReAIM proxy is a small program designed to run on (or behind) the
firewall shown in the diagram above.  It intercepts the messages going
from Alice to the AIM servers, and if the message is a direct connection
request, it changes the address Alice put in the packet from 10.0.0.5
to A.B.C.D, and keeps track that Alice has a direct connection pending.</p>

<p class="last">When Bob gets the modified message, he connects to A.B.C.D, and the proxy
answers.  With a little bit of jiggery pokery, the proxy matches up Bob's
request with Alice's pending request, and sets up a connection so that
Alice and Bob can communicate (almost) directly.</p>
