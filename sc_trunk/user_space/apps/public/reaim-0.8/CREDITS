libfaim
=======

ReAIM would not have been possible without a lot more effort on my part if it
was not for the previous work on decoding the OSCAR protocol done by
Adam Fritzler, and the others involved with the libfaim effort.

Their work is available at a number of places, as part of GAIM, and as a
protocol summary at http://www.zigamorph.net/faim/protocol.

I do not do anything close to the full OSCAR decoding that libfaim would
allow, but it has been invaluable in decoding ethereal traces to be able
to massage the parts of the transfers I needed to.


netfilter
=========

The firewalling infra-structure framework present in the Linux 2.4.x kernels
provided the way to make this proxy completely transparent to the machines 
behind the firewall.  It's less overhead to let the users download the latest
updates, and not have to do anything special for almost everything to work
correctly.

My thanks to everyone involved in making this work so smoothly.


others
======

As a general catch-all, because I'm sure to have unintentionally missed
someone impartant, thank you to the open source community as a whole.  I've
been using and contributing back for many years now, and it has been and
continues to be a great pleasure.


Cheers,

Mark
