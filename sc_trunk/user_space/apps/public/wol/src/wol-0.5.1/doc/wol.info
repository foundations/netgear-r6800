Description
***********

   `wol' broadcasts so called Magic Packet Frames across a network to
wake up hardware, that understands such packets. These are normally
NIC's with Wake On Lan function.

   `wol MAC-ADDRESS' assembles a Wake On Lan packet for hardware address
`MAC-ADDRESS'. The hardware address is written as x:x:x:x:x:x, where x
is a hexadeciml number between 0 and ff which represents on byte of the
address, which is in network byte order.

   * -i x.x.x.x, -ipaddr=x.x.x.x

     Broadcast packet to this IP Address. This is important, if you
     want to send a packet to another subnet, because not all routers
     routes packets addressed to the default IP address 0.0.0.0.

   * -p NUM, -port=NUM

     Send packet with this destination port. This option is important,
     if a packet filter would block the default destination port 40000.

   * -f FILE, -file=FILE

     Read hardware addresses, IP addresses and ports from file FILE.

   * -v, -verbose

     Turns on verbose output.

   * -w NUM, -wait=NUM

     Waits NUM milliseconds between magic packets. Also known as fuse
     health pack.

Examples
********

   * wol 00:4F:49:07:0B:5F 00:4F:50:06:12:4F

     Sends packet addressed to 0.0.0.0:40000 and is intended to wake up
     hardware address 00:4F:49:07:0B:5F and 00:4F:50:06:12:4F.

   * wol -i 192.168.3.0 -p 69 00:4F:49:07:0B:5F

     Sends packet addressed to 192.168.3.0:69 and is intended to wake
     up hardware address 00:4F:49:07:0B:5F.

   * wol -f /etc/ethers

     Read hardware address and corresponding ip address from file
     /etc/ethers.

     File looks like:

          Hardware-Address  IP-Address:Port
          Hardware-Address  IP-Address
          # Comment
          Hardware-Address  IP-Address:Port
